## Introduction

This project is part of The Odin Project's Ruby curriculum. It includes implementations of various computer science algorithms and data structures in Ruby.

## Recursion

I have made a Fibonacci function which takes a number and returns an array of Fibonacci series.

I had some challenges programming it. It was quite easy to just return a Fibonacci number rather than a series; to be honest, I couldn't solve it on my own.

Another function I made is `merge_sort`, which was quite easy considering the lecture from CS50.

## Linked List

The Linked List section includes implementations of singly and doubly linked lists. Below are some key features and methods provided:

- `Node`: A class to represent each element in the list.
- `LinkedList`: A class to manage the linked list, including methods to add, remove, and traverse nodes.


## Knight Travails

A Ruby implementation of the Knight's Travails problem, demonstrating pathfinding algorithms on a chessboard. This section includes:

- An algorithm to find the shortest path for a knight to move from one position to another on a chessboard.


## Hash Map

The Hash Map section includes the implementation of a hash map (also known as a hash table). Key features and methods include:

- `HashMap`: A class to manage the hash map.
- Methods to add, remove, and retrieve key-value pairs.
- Handling of collisions using separate chaining or open addressing.

### Key Features

- Efficiently handles key-value pair storage and retrieval.
- Supports dynamic resizing to maintain performance.
- Includes methods for common operations like insertion, deletion, and lookup.


## Binary Search Tree

The Binary Search Tree (BST) section includes the implementation of a BST with various operations such as:

- Insertion: Adding a new node to the BST.
- Deletion: Removing a node from the BST.
- Traversal: Methods to traverse the tree (level-order, in-order, pre-order, post-order).

This section demonstrates how BSTs can be used to efficiently store and retrieve data.
